## Adding dependencies

Please make sure to add dependencies using `uv`, so the project environment
is kept up to date and functional for other users.

Note that this should not be done while on the DRAC cluster and using pre-built wheels,
as those library versions do not exist elsewhere and `uv` will install Pypi versions,
not local versions - unless specifically configured to do.

To add a new dependency:

```
uv add <dependency_name>
```

To add a new dependency with a specific version:

```
uv add "<dependency_name>==<x.x.x>"
```

To add a new dependency and specify a version with some ability to update, use capped
versions, like so : `">=1.2.3,<1.3.0"`.
This is useful when you want to limit the version number but still allow bug fixes.

```
uv add "pandas>=2.3.0,<2.4.0"
```

To add a new dependency to a specific group of dependencies
(for example, the development dependencies):

```
uv add --group dev <dependency_name>
```

To make a whole group optional, add the following to your `pyproject.toml` file, where
`<group_name>` is the name of your group:

```
[project.optional-dependencies]
```

If you do add dependencies directly with pip, make sure to also add them
(preferably with a version number) to the `dependencies = []` section of
the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Design patterns

Here are two recommendations to help structure your code and make it both easier to
understand and maintain when using classes and object-oriented design.

First, a polymorphic approach, using abstract classes and their concrete implementation,
should be prioritized in order to increase maintainability and extensibility.

Therefore, new additions should try to follow this design pattern and either implement
new concrete classes or create new abstract classes and their implementations for
completely new behavior or needs.

Avoid multiple levels of inheritance; the approach should be _AbstractClass ->
[ConcreteClass1, ConcreteClass2, ...]_ and not
_AbstractClass -> ChildClass -> GrandChildClass -> ..._

Next, a dependency-injection approach should be preferred, as well as a composition
approach when creating new modules or extending existing ones.

Functional approaches are also acceptable, and even encouraged when appropriate. However,
classes are still strongly recommended for data management/representation.
This can be done with either regular classes, `dataclasses`, or `pydantic` models.

## Tests

New contributions should include appropriate tests. Pytest is the preferred library to
use for testing in this project.

To get started and to learn more about testing in Python:

- [Pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/index.html)

## Docstring and type hinting

Docstring format should follow the Numpy or Google standards, and the same standard
should be used throughout the repository.

Type hinting is strongly recommended as per the PEP8 standard:
